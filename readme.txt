INTELLLIBALLOT:INNOVATIVE FUSION OF BIOMETIRCS FOR  SECURE VOTING USING RASPBERRY PI
Steps to run our project 

Step 1: put the persons images in the faces file for face authentication.
step 2: use an suitable working fingerprint module.
step 3: do pip install required libraries in your system like cv2,dlib(go to templates folder and utilise the dlib file and install),face recognition (for installation of facce recognition u have to use python versions 3.(9-11)).
step 4: after installing all modules you wont get any errors now . start executing the project from the maim.py file . then if new data dont forgot to remove the comment from face-vote.py file main function (register_faces()--- this actually creates the dataset for the new data once createdd you can put comment again for faster execution). and u can change the vote count in both of face and finger votes.
step 5: entering 1 for face vote , 2 for finger vote. if u want to increment the total count u can put the count value in code and execute . once executed it cant repeat again .
step 6: after completion enter 3 for exit . change the reciepient mail id in result.py file to get mails to you mail id .
Hola ..... the result start now open browser and enter localhost:5000 enter the required credentials(if using in another device and using realvnc by raspberry pi use (,host="0.0.0.0") after debug=true  )
